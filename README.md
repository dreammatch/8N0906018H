Here you can find the Original TT 1.8 20VT, modified bin for an S3 2000 (CAN communication edited etc.) and the adjustment for 4-bar which I haven't tested yet.

The XDF for Tunerpro is also there.

The LC-AL-NLS file is modified on several points because the car is not very similar to stock.

Setup running with this is:

Wiseco Pistons (81,25mm)

Pauter conrods

Cat cams valve springs

Cat cams 268째/264째 - 230째/214째 camshafts

Ultra light flywheel 4kg

Spec racing clutch (single disc)

Dahlback racing intake manifold

ATP exhaust manifold T25

Garrett GT2871R turbo with 3" exhaust to end of the car

Siemens DEKA 630cc injectors

Forged intercooler kit
